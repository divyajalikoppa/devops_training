    <h1>User Management and Permissions in Linux</h1>
    
    <h2>Why User Management and Permissions are Necessary</h2>
    <p>User management and permissions are essential aspects of a Linux system for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> User management allows you to control who can access the system and what actions they can perform. Proper permissions prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Managing user accounts ensures that system resources are allocated efficiently and fairly among users.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Isolation:</strong> Each user account operates in its own environment, ensuring that one user's actions do not affect others.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Customization:</strong> User management allows users to have their own settings, preferences, and access rights tailored to their needs.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Adding Users in Linux</h2>
    <p>To add a new user in Linux:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open a terminal and log in as the root user or use the sudo command to execute administrative tasks.</li>
        <li>Use the "useradd" command followed by the desired username to create a new user. For example, to create a user named "newuser," you can use:<br>
        <code>useradd newuser</code></li>
        <li>Set a password for the new user using the "passwd" command:<br>
        <code>passwd newuser</code></li>
        <li>The user is now added, and they can log in using their username and password.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Granting Permissions in Linux</h2>
    <p>To grant permissions to users and groups:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the "chmod" command to change file permissions. You can specify permissions using symbolic notation (e.g., +r for read) or octal notation (e.g., 644 for read and write permissions for the owner and read-only for others).</li>
        <li>Use the "chown" command to change the ownership of a file or directory. You can specify both the owner and group, allowing you to control who can modify the file.</li>
        <li>Use the "chgrp" command to change the group ownership of a file or directory.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Properly managing user accounts and permissions ensures a secure and organized Linux environment.</p>
